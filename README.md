# Physics Simulation - Solutions

To get started:

* Add a physics Body (`Bounding Rectangle`) to ground and sprites

# Exercise 1:

Box

* Dynamic
* Affected by Gravity

Ground

* uncheck everything


# Exercise 2: Add a ramp

Box (no changes)

* Dynamic
* Affected By Gravity

Ground (no changes)

* uncheck everything

Ramp

* uncheck everything

** ramp behaves just like the ground **

## Exercise 3:  Add a green box


Box (no changes)

* Dynamic
* Affected By Gravity

Ground (no changes)

* uncheck everything

Ramp (no changes)

* uncheck everything

Green Box 

* uncheck everything



## Exercise 4: Push green box into hole

Update your scene so the ground has a hole


Yellow Box (no changes)

* Dynamic
* Affected By Gravity

Ground (no changes)

* uncheck everything

Ramp (no changes)

* uncheck everything

Green Box 

Physics Definition:

* Dynamic
* Affected by Gravity

Set `friction` to 0




## Exercise 5: Push green left forever

Update your scene so the ground has a hole


Yellow Box (no changes)

* Dynamic
* Affected By Gravity

Ground (no changes)

* uncheck everything

Ramp (no changes)

* uncheck everything

Green Box 

Remove `Affected By Gravity`

Physics Definition:

* Dynamic

Set `friction` to 0
